## What is OOP in c++
**OOP** stands for **Object-Oriented Programming**.
* **Procedural programming** is about writing procedures or functions that *perform operations on the data*, while **object-oriented programming** is about creating *objects that contain both data and functions*.
### Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:
* OOP is faster and easier to execute.
* OOP provides a clear structure for the programs.
* OOP helps to keep the C++ code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug.
* OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time.
